### More Information

Hello everyone, my name is Irene, I'm an undegraduate computer science student, and I'll graduate in this summer ^ ^. 

What I will post in this blog would be some useful and interesting contents. 

Since I'm lack of self-discipline at some aspects (workout, wake up on time, dessert, ...); also there're tons of things I would love to learn and to do, I want to use this blog to motivate myself to be a better me. 

My interest is data science, I'm in an intro-level now. Please feel free to contact with me if you have the same interest and want to learn it together!

:heart:
