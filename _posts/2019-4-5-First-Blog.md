# My first blog

Hello everyone, my name is Irene, I'm an undegraduate computer science student, and I'll graduate in this summer ^ ^. 

What I will post in this blog...

I wish I could share useful and interesting contents with you.

Since I'm lack of self-discipline at some aspects (workout, wake up on time, dessert, ...); also there're tons of things I would love to learn and to do, I want to use this blog to motivate myself to be a better me.
